# Gradle for Android and Java Final Project

Created an app with multiple flavors that uses
multiple libraries and Firebase. This app consists
of three modules. A Java library that provides jokes, a Firebase Realtime Database to serve jokes, an Android Library containing an
activity for displaying jokes, and an Android app that fetches jokes from Firebase Database and passes them to the Android Library for display.


* Add free and paid flavors to an app, and set up your build to share code between them
* Factor reusable functionality into a Java library
* Factor reusable Android functionality into an Android library
* Configure a multi project build to compile your libraries and app
* Use the Firebase Realtime Database to fetch and store jokes.
* Configure an integration test suite.
